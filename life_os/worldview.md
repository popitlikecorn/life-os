# Life OS Worldview Framework

## Core Philosophy
Based on Nassim Taleb's Incerto series and game theory principles.

### Mental Models
- **Asymmetry**: Hunt for bets where upside far outweighs downside
- **Antifragility**: Prefer systems that gain from disorder
- **Via Negativa**: Subtraction is improvement
- **Barbell Strategy**: Combine extreme safety + high risk/reward bets
- **Convexity**: Seek nonlinear gains
- **Lindy Effect**: What has stood the test of time

### Decision Framework
1. **No Intel → No Direction → No Execution**
2. **Path Dependencies**: Some protocols require others (planning before execution)
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Some protocols reinforce each other (workout ↔ nutrition)
4. **Scale Dependencies**: Different approaches for different scales

### Risk Management
- Always maintain optionality
- Avoid ruin at all costs
- Exploit fragility in others
- Build antifragile systems for self

### Capital Types
- **Biological Capital**: Health, energy, longevity
- **Financial Capital**: Money, assets, investments
- **Social Capital**: Relationships, reputation, networks
- **Time Capital**: Most precious and non-renewable
