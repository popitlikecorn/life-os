# Planning Protocol

## Overview
Strategic planning protocol that ensures comprehensive preparation before execution. This protocol is fractal and can be applied at any scale - from daily tasks to multi-year strategies.

## Core Principles
- **No execution without planning**
- **Planning quality determines execution success**
- **Plans are living documents that evolve**
- **Planning includes contingencies and risk mitigation**

## Go/No-Go Criteria
Before any execution can proceed, these criteria must be satisfied:

### ✅ Essential Requirements
- [ ] **Objective Clarity**: Clear, measurable goals defined
- [ ] **Resource Assessment**: Required resources identified and secured
- [ ] **Timeline**: Realistic schedule with milestones established  
- [ ] **Risk Analysis**: Major risks identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] **Success Metrics**: How success will be measured and evaluated

### ⚠️ Quality Checks
- [ ] **Stakeholder Alignment**: Key stakeholders informed and aligned
- [ ] **Dependency Mapping**: Critical dependencies identified and managed
- [ ] **Constraint Analysis**: Limitations and boundaries clearly understood
- [ ] **Alternative Scenarios**: Backup plans for likely failure modes
- [ ] **Exit Strategy**: Clear criteria for when to pivot or stop

## Planning Framework

### Phase 1: Situation Analysis
1. **Current State Assessment**
   - What is the current situation?
   - What resources are available?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Future State Vision**
   - What do we want to achieve?
   - What does success look like?
   - What are the success criteria?

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - What's the difference between current and desired state?
   - What needs to change or be acquired?
   - What are the critical path items?

### Phase 2: Strategic Design
1. **Option Generation**
   - Brainstorm multiple approaches
   - Consider radical alternatives
   - Look for asymmetric opportunities

2. **Option Evaluation**
   - Risk/reward analysis
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline implications
   - Strategic fit assessment

3. **Strategic Selection**
   - Choose primary approach
   - Identify supporting strategies
   - Design integration points

### Phase 3: Tactical Planning
1. **Work Breakdown Structure**
   - Break strategy into executable tasks
   - Define task dependencies
   - Estimate effort and duration

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Assign resources to tasks
   - Identify resource conflicts
   - Plan resource acquisition

3. **Timeline Development**
   - Create detailed schedule
   - Build in buffer time
   - Identify critical milestones

### Phase 4: Risk Management
1. **Risk Identification**
   - Technical risks
   - Resource risks
   - External risks
   - Stakeholder risks

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Probability estimation
   - Impact analysis
   - Risk scoring and prioritization

3. **Mitigation Planning**
   - Prevention strategies
   - Contingency plans
   - Risk monitoring approach

### Phase 5: Implementation Preparation
1. **Communication Plan**
   - Stakeholder communication strategy
   - Progress reporting schedule
   - Escalation procedures

2. **Monitoring Framework**
   - Key performance indicators
   - Progress tracking methods
   - Review and adjustment cycles

3. **Success Criteria**
   - Quantitative measures
   - Qualitative assessments
   - Completion definitions

## Planning Templates

### Quick Planning Template (< 1 hour efforts)
- **Objective**: What needs to be accomplished?
- **Approach**: How will it be done?
- **Resources**: What's needed?
- **Timeline**: When will it be completed?
- **Success**: How will success be measured?

### Standard Planning Template (1 day - 1 month efforts)
- **Executive Summary**
- **Situation Analysis**
- **Strategy and Approach**
- **Detailed Work Plan**
- **Resource Requirements**
- **Risk Assessment**
- **Timeline and Milestones**
- **Success Metrics**

### Strategic Planning Template (> 1 month efforts)
- **Strategic Context**
- **Comprehensive Situation Analysis**  
- **Strategic Options Analysis**
- **Detailed Implementation Plan**
- **Resource and Budget Planning**
- **Comprehensive Risk Management**
- **Stakeholder Management Plan**
- **Monitoring and Control Framework**

## Planning Quality Assurance

### Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] Is the objective clear and measurable?
- [ ] Are the assumptions explicit and reasonable?
- [ ] Is the plan realistic given available resources?
- [ ] Have major risks been identified and addressed?
- [ ] Are success criteria specific and measurable?
- [ ] Is there a clear path from current state to desired outcome?

### Peer Review Process
- Share plan with relevant stakeholders
- Request specific feedback on assumptions and risks
- Incorporate feedback and iterate
- Get final approval before execution

### Red Team Review (for critical plans)
- Assign someone to actively look for flaws
- Challenge assumptions and approach
- Simulate failure scenarios
- Strengthen plan based on challenges

## Planning Governance

### Planning Triggers
- New project or initiative launch
- Significant scope or requirement changes
- Major risk events or setbacks
- Regular planning cycles (quarterly, annually)
- Stakeholder requests for plan updates

### Planning Authority
- **Individual Level**: Personal projects and tasks
- **Team Level**: Collaborative efforts and shared objectives
- **Organizational Level**: Strategic initiatives and major changes

### Planning Documentation
- All plans must be documented and accessible
- Plans should be version controlled
- Key decisions and rationale should be captured
- Regular plan updates and reviews should be logged

## Integration with Other Protocols

### Research Protocol Integration
- Planning may trigger research requirements
- Research findings feed back into plan updates
- Continuous learning loops between planning and research

### Preparation Protocol Integration
- Plans identify what preparation is needed
- Preparation protocol ensures plan requirements are met
- Execution cannot proceed without both planning and preparation

### Operation Protocol Integration
- Plans guide operational execution
- Operational feedback informs plan adjustments
- Regular sync between planning and operations

## Success Metrics

### Planning Process Metrics
- Time from planning start to execution ready
- Quality of initial plans (measured by execution success)
- Frequency of major plan revisions
- Stakeholder satisfaction with planning process

### Planning Outcome Metrics  
- Execution success rate for planned initiatives
- Variance between planned and actual outcomes
- Early identification and mitigation of risks
- Achievement of planned objectives within timeline and budget

## Continuous Improvement

### Planning Process Reviews
- Regular retrospectives on planning effectiveness
- Identify common planning gaps or blind spots
- Update planning templates and checklists
- Share planning best practices and lessons learned

### Planning Skill Development
- Strategic thinking and systems analysis
- Risk assessment and scenario planning
- Project management and resource planning
- Communication and stakeholder management

*This planning protocol should be adapted based on the scale and context of what's being planned, and continuously improved based on execution outcomes.*
