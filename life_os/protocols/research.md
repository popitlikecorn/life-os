# Research Protocol

## Purpose
Systematic approach to gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information for decision-making.

## Trigger Conditions
- New domain to understand
- Investment/opportunity evaluation needed
- Strategic decision requires data
- Knowledge gap identified

## Protocol Steps

### Phase 1: Scope Definition
1. Define research question clearly
2. Identify information needed
3. Set success criteria
4. Allocate time/resource budget

### Phase 2: Source Identification
1. Primary sources (direct data, interviews)
2. Secondary sources (reports, studies)
3. Contrarian viewpoints
4. Expert opinions

### Phase 3: Information Gathering
1. Systematic data collection
2. Source credibility assessment
3. Bias identification
4. Cross-validation

### Phase 4: Analysis

2. Trend analysis
3. Gap identification
4. Contradiction resolution

### Phase 5: Synthesis
1. Key insights extraction
2. Actionable recommendations
3. Confidence levels
4. Further research needs

## Success Criteria
- Clear, actionable insights generated
- Sources credible and diverse
- Biases identified and accounted for
- Recommendations practical and specific

## Dependencies
