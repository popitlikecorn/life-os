# Life OS Core Worldview Framework

## Executive Summary
This is my personal operating philosophy built on Nassim Taleb's Incerto series, game theory, and antifragile design principles. It serves as the foundational context for all strategic decisions and protocol development.

## Core Philosophy & Mental Models

### Primary Mental Models
- **Asymmetry**: Hunt for bets where upside far outweighs downside (minimum 3:1, prefer 10:1+)
- **Antifragility**: Build systems that gain from disorder, stress, and volatility
- **Via Negativa**: Improvement through subtraction - remove the harmful rather than add
- **Barbell Strategy**: Combine extreme safety (80%) with extreme risk/high reward (20%)
- **Convexity**: Seek nonlinear gains that accelerate with input
- **Lindy Effect**: What has survived long has longer expected survival
- **Skin in the Game**: Only trust those who have real consequences from their advice

### Virtue Stack (Hierarchical)
1. **Honor**: Integrity and skin in the game in all dealings - never compromise
2. **Glory**: Excellence and mastery in chosen domains - build reputation through results
3. **Bravery**: Calculated risk-taking with asymmetric upside - courage under uncertainty
4. **Gallantry**: Noble conduct especially under pressure - grace in difficult situations
5. **Chivalry**: Protection of the vulnerable and just causes - strength serves others

## Strategic Worldview Assessment

### Current Game Theoretic Understanding
- **Primary Game**: Individual skill/network/capital development in AI-accelerated world
- **Secondary Games**: Professional positioning, social capital building, geographic arbitrage
- **Meta Game**: System design for continuous evolution and adaptation
- **Dominant Strategy**: Preserve optionality while building convex positions

### Current Environmental Analysis
- **Technology**: AI revolution creating massive skill arbitrage opportunities
- **Economics**: Persistent inflation and asset bubbles creating hedge requirements
- **Geopolitics**: Decentralization trends creating new sovereignty and location options
- **Social**: Declining institutional trust creating premium for direct relationships
- **Personal**: Building antifragile positioning across all capital types

## Capital Framework

### Four Capital Types (All Must Be Optimized)
1. **Biological Capital**: Health, energy, longevity, cognitive performance
2. **Financial Capital**: Money, assets, investments, passive income streams
3. **Social Capital**: Relationships, reputation, networks, influence
4. **Time Capital**: Most precious and non-renewable, must be leveraged optimally

### Capital Deployment Principles
- Never deploy capital without edge, hedge, and leverage
- Optimize for compound growth across all capital types
- Maintain barbell approach: extreme safety + extreme upside
- Build antifragile systems that benefit from volatility

## Decision Framework

### Strategic Decision Process
1. **Intel Check**: No direction without frontier intelligence and environmental scanning
2. **Worldview Alignment**: Must align with virtue stack and mental models
3. **Asymmetry Assessment**: Minimum 3:1 upside/downside, prefer 10:1+
4. **Optionality Preservation**: Never close off future opportunities unnecessarily
5. **Antifragile Positioning**: Prefer strategies that gain from volatility and stress
6. **Dependency Management**: Map path, circular, and scale dependencies clearly

### Go/No-Go Criteria for Any Bet
- **Edge**: Clear competitive advantage or information asymmetry
- **Hedge**: Limited downside or built-in protection mechanisms
- **Leverage**: Force multiplier that amplifies positive outcomes
- **Alignment**: Consistent with long-term worldview and virtue stack
- **Optionality**: Preserves or creates future choices and flexibility

## Risk Management Philosophy

### Ruin Avoidance (Absolute Priority)
- Never bet amounts that could lead to ruin
- Always maintain multiple income streams and safety nets
- Build redundancy into all critical systems
- Maintain geographic, political, and economic diversification

### Fragility Detection
- Continuously scan for fragile systems that could break under stress
- Build hedges against identified fragilities (employment, platform dependence, currency)
- Position to benefit when fragile systems break (asymmetric opportunities)

### Black Swan Preparation
- Build antifragile systems that benefit from unexpected events
- Maintain optionality to pivot when new information emerges
- Keep significant resources in "barbell" safety zone
- Stay alert to early signals of regime changes

## Execution Philosophy

### Protocol Hierarchy
- **Intel Branch**: Continuous environmental scanning and asymmetric opportunity detection
- **Directional Branch**: Game theory strategic planning and worldview alignment
- **Executive Branch**: Systematic execution with continuous monitoring and adaptation

### Dependency Management
- **Path Dependencies**: Some protocols require others (planning before execution)
- **Circular Dependencies**: Some protocols reinforce each other (health â†” performance)
- **Scale Dependencies**: Different approaches for different scales and contexts

### Continuous Evolution
- All protocols, heuristics, and strategies are living documents
- Regular review and update based on outcomes and new intelligence
- Integration of new insights from books, conversations, experiences
- Antifragile system design that improves from stress and feedback

## Current Strategic Priorities

### Immediate Focus (Next 90 Days)
1. AI skill development for massive arbitrage opportunity
2. Geographic arbitrage research and implementation
3. Direct audience building to hedge platform fragility
4. Multiple income stream development

### Medium-term Positioning (6-18 Months)
1. Antifragile business model development
2. Network effects optimization through content creation
3. Financial hedging against currency and inflation fragility
4. Health and longevity optimization systems

### Long-term Vision (2-5 Years)
1. Location-independent, antifragile lifestyle design
2. Multiple streams of convex, passive income
3. Strong social network of high-quality relationships
4. Mastery in chosen domains with reputation and influence

## Context for AI Agents

This worldview framework should inform all strategic recommendations, opportunity assessments, and protocol development. Every suggestion should be evaluated against these principles:

- Does it create asymmetric upside?
- Does it preserve or increase optionality?
- Is it antifragile (benefits from volatility)?
- Does it align with the virtue stack?
- Does it optimize across all capital types?
- Does it avoid potential ruin scenarios?

Use this as the foundational context for all intelligence gathering, strategic planning, and execution recommendations.
